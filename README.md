## Description

A simple work day scheduler made using the basics of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS with massive help from Day.js and jQuery which does the heavy lifting of making the code run.

## Credits
I obtained the starter code from the MSU Fullstack Bootcamp. I gained the knowledge to use .toggleClass, .removeClass and .addClass from [Thomas Calle](https://github.com/ThomasCalle) to allow for me to add and remove class names onto the different div tags.
